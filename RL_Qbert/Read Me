I included to main versions of my code, please read Qlearn.py, which is my reinforcement
learner program.  It requires blockpositions.csv, Sarsa.py,  and ScreenFunc.py, qbert.bin to be in the same folder to run.

readQAct.py is used for when you have a Q lookup table already made, and you want to begin
learning from that point.  It will run with Ap4qtableEpisode49.csv , you can modify the 
file name.

To update random seed look around line 22 in Qlearn.py and line 25 readQAct.py

To run file must have ALE installed, navigate to the folder with the code installed and 
enter



python QLearn.py qbert.bin

or

python readQAct.py qbert.bin
