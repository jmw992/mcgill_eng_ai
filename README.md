# mcgill_eng_ai
**Overview**
This folder is a collection of problems and asigments I worked on during a particular class at mcgill.  It represent work i've completed in assignments and practice problems.  Each folder is a different project and were not originally made with github in mind.  Most projects were written in python calling some additional libraries, ALE (arcade learing environrment), simple ai, pandas.  Assignment1 was written in c++.
